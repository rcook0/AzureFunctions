# Azure Functions Monorepo

This repository contains multiple **Azure Function Apps**, each in its own subfolder.  
The apps can be developed and tested independently, but share a single CI/CD workflow that deploys them all automatically.

See CONNECTIONS.md for details on configuring connection strings.
